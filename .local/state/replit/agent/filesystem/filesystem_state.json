Navigate to the dashboard\n2. Click on \"Video Library\" section\n3. Browse videos by category\n4. Click on any video to watch\n5. Progress is automatically tracked\n\n### For Admins\n1. Login to admin panel (`/admin/login`)\n2. Navigate to \"Video Management\" (`/admin/videos`)\n3. Click \"Add Video\" to upload new content\n4. Fill in video details and metadata\n5. Choose upload type (file or YouTube)\n6. Save and publish\n\n## File Structure\n\n```\nclient/src/\n├── components/\n│   ├── enhanced-video-upload.tsx      # Video upload component\n│   ├── enhanced-video-library.tsx     # Video library display\n│   └── video-section.tsx              # Existing video section\n├── pages/\n│   ├── admin/\n│   │   └── AdminVideoManagement.tsx   # Admin video management\n│   └── video-upload.tsx               # Existing upload page\nserver/\n├── services/\n│   └── cloudflare-r2.ts               # R2 integration service\n└── routes.ts                          # API routes\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n### Test Video Upload\n1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`\n2. Login as admin: `admin@example.com` / `admin123`\n3. Navigate to `/admin/videos`\n4. Click \"Add Video\"\n5. Test both file upload and YouTube embed\n\n### Test Video Library\n1. Login as regular user\n2. Navigate to dashboard\n3. Check video library section\n4. Test video playback and progress tracking\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n1. **R2 Upload Fails**\n   - Check R2 credentials in `.env`\n   - Verify bucket exists and has correct permissions\n   - Check CORS settings if using browser uploads\n\n2. **Videos Not Loading**\n   - Verify R2 bucket is public or has proper access\n   - Check video URLs in database\n   - Test R2 access URLs manually\n\n3. **Progress Not Tracking**\n   - Check database connection\n   - Verify user authentication\n   - Check API endpoint responses\n\n### Debug Mode\nEnable debug logging by setting:\n```bash\nDEBUG=video-upload,cloudflare-r2\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. **File Validation**: Only allow video file types\n2. **Size Limits**: Set reasonable file size limits (500MB recommended)\n3. **Access Control**: Ensure only admins can upload/delete videos\n4. **R2 Permissions**: Use least-privilege access for R2 credentials\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n1. **CDN**: Use Cloudflare CDN for video delivery\n2. **Compression**: Compress videos before upload\n3. **Thumbnails**: Generate thumbnails for better UX\n4. **Caching**: Implement proper caching for video metadata\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n- [ ] Video transcoding for multiple formats\n- [ ] Automatic thumbnail generation\n- [ ] Video analytics and viewing statistics\n- [ ] Batch upload functionality\n- [ ] Video playlist management\n- [ ] Offline video support\n- [ ] Video subtitles and captions\n","size_bytes":6627},"client/src/components/sports-heroes-matching.tsx":{"content":"import { useState, useMemo } from \"react\";\nimport { Card, CardContent } from

OpenAI API Key\n- **Required**: Set up an OpenAI API key\n- **Environment Variable**: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here`\n- **Cost**: OpenAI TTS charges per character (very affordable for educational content)\n\n### 2. Server Configuration\nThe following TTS services are already implemented:\n\n#### Available Services:\n- **OpenAI Enhanced TTS** (`/server/services/openai-tts-enhanced.ts`)\n  - High-quality AI voices with personality\n  - Multiple voice options (British, American, Historian, Storyteller)\n  - Text enhancement for historical content\n  - Audio caching for performance\n\n- **Basic OpenAI TTS** (`/server/services/openai-tts-service.ts`)\n  - Simple TTS with language support\n  - Multiple language options\n\n#### API Endpoints:\n- `GET /api/tts-enhanced/voices` - Get available voice options\n- `POST /api/tts-enhanced/narrate` - Generate AI narration\n- `POST /api/tts-enhanced/narrate-multiple` - Generate multiple voice options\n- `GET /api/tts-enhanced/audio/:filename` - Serve audio files\n- `GET /api/tts-enhanced/cache-stats` - Get cache statistics\n- `DELETE /api/tts-enhanced/cache` - Clear audio cache\n\n### 3. Frontend Integration\nThe enhanced TTS component (`browser-tts-narration.tsx`) now supports:\n\n#### Features:\n- **Dual Mode**: AI TTS (when online) + Browser TTS (fallback)\n- **Network Detection**: Automatically switches to browser TTS when offline\n- **Voice Selection**: Multiple AI voice personalities\n- **Audio Caching**: Server-side caching for performance\n- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to browser TTS\n- **Real-time Controls**: Play, pause, stop, mute, volume control\n\n#### Voice Options:\n1. **James (British Male)** - Deep, authoritative, historical narrator\n2. **Emma (British Female)** - Clear, articulate, professional\n3. **Michael (American Male)** - Warm, conversational, modern\n4. **Sarah (American Female)** - Bright, energetic, engaging\n5. **Professor Williams (Historian)** - Scholarly, distinguished, academic\n6. **Lady Catherine (Storyteller)** - Elegant, narrative, dramatic\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n### 1. Environment Setup\n```bash\n# Add to your .env file\nOPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here\n```\n\n### 2. Install Dependencies\nAll required dependencies are already in `package.json`:\n- `openai` - OpenAI API client\n- `express` - Server framework\n- `fs/promises` - File system operations\n\n### 3. Start the Server\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n### 4. Test the TTS System\n```bash\n# Test voice options\ncurl http://localhost:5000/api/tts-enhanced/voices\n\n# Test narration generation\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/tts-enhanced/narrate \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"text\": \"Hello, this is a test of the AI narration system.\",\n    \"voiceKey\": \"british_female\",\n    \"eventId\": \"test-123\"\n  }'\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n### 1. AI TTS Process:\n1. User clicks \"Listen\" button\n2. Component checks if online and AI TTS is enabled\n3. Sends text to `/api/tts-enhanced/narrate` endpoint\n4. Server enhances text for better speech (adds pauses, emphasis)\n5. OpenAI generates high-quality audio using selected voice\n6. Audio is cached on server for future use\n7. Audio URL is returned to frontend\n8. Frontend plays audio using HTML5 Audio API\n\n### 2. Fallback Process:\n1. If AI TTS fails or user is offline\n2. Component automatically falls back to browser TTS\n3. Uses browser's built-in `speechSynthesis` API\n4. Matches voice selection to available browser voices\n\n### 3. Caching System:\n- Audio files are cached in `/uploads/audio_cache/`\n- Cache key based on text content, voice, and options\n- Prevents regenerating identical audio\n- Improves performance and reduces API costs\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues:\n\n1. **\"AI narration failed\" error**\n   - Check if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly\n   - Verify OpenAI API key is valid and has credits\n   - Check server logs for detailed error messages\n\n2. **Audio not playing**\n   - Check browser console for audio errors\n   - Verify audio file URL is accessible\n   - Try refreshing the page\n\n3. **Fallback to browser TTS**\n   - This is normal behavior when offline\n   - AI TTS requires internet connection\n   - Browser TTS works offline but with limited voice options\n\n### Debug Steps:\n1. Check server logs for TTS generation errors\n2. Test API endpoints directly with curl\n3. Verify audio files are being created in `/uploads/audio_cache/`\n4. Check browser network tab for failed requests\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Optimization:\n- Audio files are cached to avoid regeneration\n- Server-side text enhancement improves speech quality\n- Fallback to browser TTS reduces server load\n- Network detection prevents unnecessary API calls\n\n### Cost Management:\n- OpenAI TTS charges per character\n- Caching reduces duplicate API calls\n- Browser TTS fallback reduces API usage\n- Consider implementing usage limits for production\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n### Potential Improvements:\n1. **Voice Cloning**: Custom voice training\n2. **Emotion Detection**: Adjust voice based on content emotion\n3. **Multi-language**: Automatic language detection\n4. **SSML Support**: Advanced speech markup\n5. **Real-time Streaming**: Stream audio as it's generated\n6. **Voice Comparison**: Side-by-side voice testing\n\n## API Reference\n\n### Generate Narration\n```typescript\nPOST /api/tts-enhanced/narrate\n{\n  \"text\": \"Text to narrate\",\n  \"voiceKey\": \"british_female\",\n  \"eventId\": \"unique-event-id\",\n  \"enhanceForHistory\": true,\n  \"addEmphasis\": true\n}\n\nResponse:\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"audioUrl\": \"/api/audio/filename.mp3\",\n  \"voiceInfo\": { ... },\n  \"duration\": 30,\n  \"eventId\": \"unique-event-id\",\n  \"textLength\": 150\n}\n```\n\n### Get Voice Options\n```typescript\nGET /api/tts-enhanced/voices\n\nResponse:\n{\n  \"voices\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"british_female\",\n      \"name\": \"Emma (British Female)\",\n      \"description\": \"Clear, articulate British female voice\",\n      \"characteristics\": \"Professional, engaging, educational\",\n      \"accent\": \"British\",\n      \"gender\": \"female\",\n      \"speed\": 0.95,\n      \"pitch\": 1.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"totalVoices\": 6,\n  \"categories\": { ... }\n}\n```\n\nThis setup provides a robust, high-quality TTS system with intelligent fallbacks and excellent

Run this SQL:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS games (\n    id varchar PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() NOT NULL,\n    title text NOT NULL,\n    description text NOT NULL,\n    category text NOT NULL,\n    game_type text NOT NULL,\n    difficulty text DEFAULT 'intermediate' NOT NULL,\n    is_active boolean DEFAULT true NOT NULL,\n    order_index integer DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,\n    game_data jsonb,\n    instructions text,\n    estimated_time integer,\n    tags jsonb,\n    created_at timestamp DEFAULT now(),\n    updated_at timestamp DEFAULT now()\n);\n```\n\n## Step 2: Populate with Existing Games Data\n\nRun the SQL script `insert-games.sql` to populate the database with all the existing games from the games page.\n\nYou can do this by:\n\n1. **Using psql command line:**\n   ```bash\n   psql -d your_database_name -f insert-games.sql\n   ```\n\n2. **Using pgAdmin or another PostgreSQL client:**\n   - Open the `insert-games.sql` file\n   - Copy and paste the contents\n   - Execute the SQL\n\n3. **Using your application's database connection:**\n   - The SQL file contains all the INSERT statements needed\n\n## Step 3: Verify the Data\n\nAfter running the SQL, you should have 23 games in your database:\n\n- 1 AI Generated game\n- 1 True/False game  \n- 1 Flip Cards game\n- 20 Matching games (2-column and 3-column)\n\n## Step 4: Test the Admin Interface\n\n1. Navigate to `/admin/games` in your application\n2. You should see all the games listed\n3. You can create, edit, and delete games\n4. The games are now managed through the database instead of hardcoded components\n\n## Games Categories:\n\n- **ai-generated**: AI-powered exercise generator\n- **true-false**: True/False challenge games\n- **flip-cards**: Interactive flip card games\n- **matching**: Various matching games (2-column and 3-column)\n\n## Game Types:\n\n- **ai-exercises**: AI-generated personalized exercises\n- **true-false**: True/False statement games\n- **flip-cards**: Card flipping games\n- **matching-cards**: Matching games with different complexities\n\n## Difficulty Levels:\n\n- **beginner**: Easy games for new learners\n- **intermediate**: Moderate difficulty games\n- **advanced**: Complex games requiring deeper knowledge\n\nThe admin interface now provides full CRUD operations for managing all these games through the database!\n","size_bytes":2415},"client/src/components/flip-cards.tsx":{"content":"import { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { Card, CardContent } from \"@/components/ui/card\";\nimport { Badge } from \"@/components/ui/badge\";\nimport { Button } from \"@/components/ui/button\";\nimport { RotateCcw, Check } from \"lucide-react\";\nimport { celebrateCorrectMatch, celebrateGameComplete } from \"@/lib/confetti\";\n\ninterface FlipCard {\n  id: string;\n  front: string;\n  back: string;\n  category: string;\n}\n\nconst flipCardsData: FlipCard[] = [\n  {\n    id: \"1\",\n    front: \"What is the capital of Scotland?\",\n    back: \"Edinburgh\",\n    category: \"Geography\"\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"2\", \n    front: \"When did women get the right to vote in the UK?\",\n    back: \"1918 (partial) and 1928 (full equality)\",\n    category: \"History\"\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"3\",\n    front: \"What are the fundamental British values?\",\n    back: \"Democracy, Rule of Law, Individual Liberty, Mutual Respect and Tolerance\",\n    category: \"Values\"\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"4\",\n    front: \"Who is the head of state in the UK?\",\n    back: \"The Monarch (currently King Charles III)\",\n    category: \"Government\"\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"5\",\n    front: \"What is the Church of England also known as?\",\n    back: \"The Anglican Church\",\n    category: \"Religion\"\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"6\",\n    front: \"When is St. George's Day?\",\n    back: \"April 23rd\",\n    category: \"Culture\"\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"7\",\n    front: \"What does the Union Jack represent?\",\n    back: \"The combination of England (St. George's Cross), Scotland (St. Andrew's Cross), and Northern Ireland (St. Patrick's Cross)\",\n    category: \"Symbols\"\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"8\",\n    front: \"What is the highest court in the UK?\",\n    back: \"The Supreme Court\",\n    category: \"Government\"\n  }\n];\n\ninterface FlipCardsProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nexport default function FlipCards({ userId }: FlipCardsProps) {\n  const [flippedCards, setFlippedCards] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());\n  const [completedCards, setCompletedCards] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());\n  const [selectedCategory, setSelectedCategory] = useState<string>(\"All\");\n\n  const categories = [\"All\", ...Array.from(new Set(flipCardsData.map(card => card.category)))];\n  \n  const filteredCards = selectedCategory === \"All\" \n    ?
